🧠 SVM Classification Project

📌 Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classification tasks using Python and Jupyter Notebook.
It is designed as a machine learning project to understand how SVM can be applied to real-world datasets for pattern recognition and prediction.

🔮 Future Improvements

Add hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

Compare with other classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Extend to multi-class classification problems

Deploy as a simple web app using Flask or Streamlit
